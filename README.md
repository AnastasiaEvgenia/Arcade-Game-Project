# Frogger Game.

Nanodegree program. The objective of the project is to 
re-create a simple arcade game.

## Game Discription.

The game consists of an area made of different blocks (grass,
stone and water), a player figure and the enemies (bugs). The 
enemies can only move in the stone blocks and the player
can move everywhere. The player starts from the grass block.

The objective of the game is for the player to reach to the
water blocks without making contact with the enemy. If the 
player does come in contact with the enemies he loses the game
and has to start from square one. Uppon reaching the water
player wins and game restarts.
